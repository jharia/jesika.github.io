# Beyond V1

This guide was a compilation of our learnings putting out V1 of LogicLoop's AI SQL Copilot and Ask AI Features, and we expect this to evolve quickly in the next few weeks and months.&#x20;

Some areas that are most likely to see updates are around:&#x20;

* **Model Selection**: as LLM providers have model updates and new providers come out, we'll add more to our decision-making framework.
* **Model Testing & Security**: as customers starting using AI features, we'll have a stronger story around security of these models as an industry.
* **Feature Pricing**: as customers start realizing the full benefits of AI features, vendors will be able to charge for them more consistently.&#x20;

Stay tuned!
