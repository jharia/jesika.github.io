# Who this guide is for

This guide is for technical and product leaders who want to integrate LLMs into their SaaS applications quickly, safely and in a useful manner.

You will find this guide useful if:

* You are being asked by your investors or your CEO to “figure out your AI strategy” and want a quick primer on what to watch for
* You have a few vague ideas for where you can integrate LLMs into your user flow, or have a few engineers assigned, and want to know what other companies are doing
* You may have started implementation or even released a beta version, and are thinking about what's next
