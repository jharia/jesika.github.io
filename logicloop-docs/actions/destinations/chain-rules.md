# Chain Rules

You can have an action form a rule trigger another LogicLoop rule. This can be useful when the results of a query can be used as parameters in the next rule.

Select the **Trigger Rule** action subscription to set up your chain of rules

#### Selecting Your Rule

You must select the rule you want to trigger from your action. By default, the most recent 10 rules can be viewed in a dropdown. You can also search for any rule by name.

#### Passing Parameters

You can pass information from your action to the next query's [parameters](../../queries/rules/more-rule-options.md). You can use [action templating](../templating.md) to customize and define your chained rule.
