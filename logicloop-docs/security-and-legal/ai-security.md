# AI Security

LogicLoop handles all customer data in a safe and compliant manner. LogicLoop's AI-enabled features, such as Ask AI and Query Helper, use third-party LLLMs to offer users the best experience.&#x20;

We currently use OpenAI's APIs to power AI-enabled features. Here's how LogicLoop keeps your data scure:

* Only your data schema is sent to OpenAI, not your actual data.
* OpenAI does not use API data to train its models ([source](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies)).
* If your organization uses an LLM Firewall provider such as Private.ai, Arthur.ai, please email support@logicloop.com to integrate.
* LogicLoop is partnering with other privacy-focused LLM Cloud providers like Google and Anthropic, please email support@logicloop.com to discuss your needs.
* LogicLoop is considering hosting our own models inside our SOC2 Type 2 compliant infrastructure, please email support@logicloop.com to discuss your needs.
