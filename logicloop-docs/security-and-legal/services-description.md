# Services description

### Mission

LogicLoop's mission is to empower operations teams to unlock their maximum productivity with a modern operations stack. We enable semi-technical users to set up the critical workflows they need to automate their business. Our low-code solution retains enough flexibility to capture your business' complexity, but is accessible to non-engineering users, enabling your organization to best leverage your resources.

### Products

Our core product, LogicLoop, is a software tool that allows users to connect to data sources, write SQL-based queries, and trigger alerts, notifications, and other business workflows. LogicLoop helps companies automate their business workflows and modernize their operations stack.&#x20;

### Application deployment

Our application can be accessed as a SaaS service through our web application, or as on-premises enterprise solution that is self-hosted and deployed on your own company servers.

### Business model

Users of our SaaS product pay us a recurring monthly SaaS fee administrated through Stripe. Enterprise users sign monthly or annual contracts with pricing subject to needs.&#x20;

### Support services

For enterprise customers, we also offer dedicated customer support services M-F 9am-5pm PT.&#x20;

### Updates

From time to time, LogicLoop may distribute service updates. Non-breaking updates may be performed during short planned downtime windows. Customers may check our status page for notices of planned maintenance windows greater than 15 minutes. Breaking updates will be communicated to customers via Email or Slack before they are released.

### Commitment&#x20;

LogicLoop is committed to excellent services and industry best practices in security, availability, and confidentiality.&#x20;
