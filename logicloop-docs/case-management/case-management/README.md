# Case Management

Sometimes, it's not enough just to write rules to raise an alert or action. You need a way of managing these alerts to keep track of who is responsible for resolving them and when. You might want your rules to create a ticket in a case management system so your operators can triage and review alerts. If you're using an existing system like Asana, Clubhouse, or JIRA, you can use our [webhooks integration ](../../actions/destinations/webhooks.md)to make an API call to those third-party systems to create a ticket in those systems.&#x20;

You can also use LogicLoop's in-house case management system by clicking on **Tickets** in your navigation sidebar. LogicLoop lets you create, assign, triage, and archive tickets so you can manage your outstanding alerts.
