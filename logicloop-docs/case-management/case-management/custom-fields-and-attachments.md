### Adding Custom Fields to a Ticket

Once you have created your Custom Field, you can add it to a ticket in two ways:

1. In the Ticket: Choose the "Add Ticket Custom Field" button, then select the field name and value you wish to add.
2. In an Action: Create a LogicLoop Ticket action subscription, go to advanced settings, and click "+ Add Custom Field". Choose the field name and value you wish to add.

If you need to edit or delete a custom field, follow these steps:
