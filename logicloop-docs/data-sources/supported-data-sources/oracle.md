## Prerequisites

* [ ] Data source [allows access to LogicLoop](../data-sources/deployment-options.md) if necessary
* [ ] [Deployment](../data-sources/deployment-options.md) works for organization and data source
* [ ] LogicLoop user account is an [admin](../../teams/groups-and-permissions.md) to be able to create a data source

## Setup

Connecting your Oracle database to LogicLoop is easy. If you're an admin user, you will be able to go to the Settings panel and add a new data source of type Oracle.
